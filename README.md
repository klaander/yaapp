# Yat Another Audio and Podcast Player

The intention of this app is to become the best possible Android audio player
for me personally. :-) As a bonus, it will also be my learning platform for
anything new I want to learn about Android development.

This application is forked from https://github.com/valdio/AudioPlayer, as that
seemed to provide a good basis for further tweaking. The related article at
https://www.sitepoint.com/a-step-by-step-guide-to-building-an-android-audio-player-app/
was my original inspiration.

I most probably won't make an effort to keep up with possible updates in
upstream project.
